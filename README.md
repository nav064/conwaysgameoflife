# Conway's Game of Life - An oversimplified version though

Use function "play" to run the game.

**play function has these parameters

board - 2 dimensional array. The output will be captured in this. 

state - 2 dimensional array. The initial state of the board. Watch the fun when you change values on this. 

timeline - Number of times the conway propagation needs to run/repeat. This is equivalent to time in the realistic sense. 


**States of the cells in each array

0 - dead organism

1 - live organism



Please feel free to test/reuse/modify. 


The eventual question I had is **"Are we just a Conway's game of our genes?"
