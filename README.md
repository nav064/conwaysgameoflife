# Conway's Game of Life - An oversimplified version though

Use function "play" to run the game

board - 2 dimensional array. The output will be captured in this. 
state - 2 dimensional array. The initial state of the board. Watch the fun when you change values on this. 
timeline - Number of times the conway propagation needs to run/repeat. This is equivalent to time in the realistic sense. 

0 - dead organism
1 - live organism

Please feel free to test/reuse/modify. 

The eventual question I had is "Are we just a Conway's game of our genes?"
